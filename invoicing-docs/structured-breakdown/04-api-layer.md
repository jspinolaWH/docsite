## Billing Events

### POST /billing-events
Creates a new billing event from an external source (route management, weighbridge, POS integration).
> **PD-299:** *"Event data can also be generated via a weighbridge integration or a cashier/POS system integration."*

Request body contains the full event schema. The service resolves VAT rate by event date, resolves legal classification by customer and product, and sets status = IN_PROGRESS.

### POST /billing-events/manual
Creates a manually entered billing event.
> **PD-283:** *"Users can manually enter invoicing events for services that do not originate from automated integrations."*

The user provides: customer ID, product ID, quantity/hours, date, and optional comment. The product ID drives all financial metadata — the user cannot set accounts or VAT manually.

### GET /billing-events
Returns a filtered list of billing events.
> **PD-318:** *"Billing events must be viewable and filterable according to the ongoing billing run, for example by date, products of a specific service, municipality, or service responsibility."*

Supports query parameters: customerId, status, municipality, dateFrom, dateTo, productId, serviceResponsibility, excluded, requiresReview.

### GET /billing-events/{id}
Returns full details of a single billing event including audit history.
> **PD-277:** *"The system generates before-and-after records, ensuring transparency and providing references for customer inquiries."*

### PATCH /billing-events/{id}
Edits a billing event's correctable fields.
> **PD-277:** *"Authorized users can update event data, including product quantities, event type, contractor fees, and customer price."*

Requires a `reason` field in the request body. Blocked if event status is SENT or COMPLETED.

### POST /billing-events/{id}/exclude
Excludes a single event from invoicing.
> **PD-318:** *"Users can exclude an individual event from invoicing."*

### POST /billing-events/{id}/reinstate
Reinstates a previously excluded event.
> **PD-318:** *"Users can update the status of these events later once the issue has been resolved."*

### POST /billing-events/bulk-exclude
Excludes multiple events at once.
> **PD-318:** *"Bulk exclusion: Office staff can select and exclude multiple events from invoicing in a single step."*

Request body: list of event IDs and a shared exclusion reason.

### POST /billing-events/{id}/transfer
Transfers a single unbilled event to a different customer.
> **PD-276:** *"Uninvoiced transactions must be able to be transferred and allocated from one customer/target to another."*

### POST /billing-events/bulk-transfer
Transfers multiple unbilled events to a different customer.
> **PD-344:** *"Billing events must be transferable from one customer to another, for example when a resident changes."*

### POST /billing-events/validate
Runs pre-billing validation checks on a list of events without starting a run.
> **PD-278:** *"An event must have mandatory data, such as accounts and cost centres, in order for it to be transferred to billing."*

Returns events waiting for office review.
> **PD-228:** *"Events must be able to be reviewed in bulk for error detection."*

### POST /billing-events/{id}/approve
Office user approves a driver-submitted event.
> **PD-228:** *"Additional tasks can be registered directly to the customer's invoice without requiring separate confirmation by the office user"* — and by implication, those that DO require confirmation need an approval action.

### POST /billing-events/{id}/reject
Office user rejects a driver-submitted event with a reason.

Starts a new invoice run (real or simulation).
> **PD-272:** *"Users can run a test run that generates invoice data without finalizing or sending invoices."*
> **PD-293:** *"It must be possible to define different limit conditions for printing the invoice."*
