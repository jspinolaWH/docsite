# Sprint 1 Overview

## Sprint Goals

The primary goal of Sprint 1 is to establish the foundational data model for the pricing system.

### Key Objectives

1. **Design Entity Relationship Model**
   - Define all entities (Price Lists, Products, Zones, etc.)
   - Establish relationships between entities
   - Create initial database schema

2. **Implement Basic CRUD Operations**
   - Create API endpoints for basic operations
   - Implement data validation
   - Set up database migrations

3. **Create Initial Documentation**
   - Document the pricing model architecture
   - Define business rules
   - Create developer guides

## Deliverables

- [ ] Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- [ ] Database schema implementation
- [ ] API endpoints for Price Lists
- [ ] API endpoints for Products
- [ ] Technical documentation
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality

## Timeline

- **Start Date**: January 15, 2026
- **End Date**: January 29, 2026
- **Duration**: 2 weeks

## Team

- **Product Owner**: Jack Spinola
- **Developers**: TBD
- **QA**: TBD

## Success Criteria

Sprint 1 will be considered successful when:

1. All database entities are properly defined and created
2. Basic CRUD operations work for Price Lists and Products
3. All unit tests pass
4. Documentation is complete and reviewed
5. Code is merged to main branch

## Dependencies

No external dependencies for Sprint 1 - this is the foundation sprint.

## Risks

- **Risk**: Database schema may need revisions after initial design
  - **Mitigation**: Plan for schema migration strategy from the start

- **Risk**: Incomplete understanding of all business rules
  - **Mitigation**: Regular sync meetings with stakeholders

## Notes

This sprint focuses on getting the foundation right. Speed is secondary to correctness and completeness.
